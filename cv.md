### About me:
My career path doesn't look like simple exponential growth but I consider that a plus. I have an engeenering and linguistic degrees. At the beginnig of my career I worked for some manufacturing companies. My duties were working with manufacturing documentation (procedures, process and work instructions, different types of specifications) and production drawings. Then I decided to travel and now I'm working in China as an English language teacher. But I was always interested in technologies and machines. As I think that it's our future and we can make it better using AI and algorithms. That's how I came up with my own mission to use my sense of beauty and admiration of human mind to make our life better and more worthwhile; and to do so with passion, compassion, humor, style and joy. I want to make a difference and a contribution. So, I started with learning programming languages and building web pages as the most accessible way of working with data structures. And in the future I'm going to keep on getting more and more knowledge in this sphere.
